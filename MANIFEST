# NOTES
# For each word:
#   If the word is a number matching [0-9]+ then search for this number
#   twice, once as a decimal and once as hexadecimal; e.g., '97' → 97
#   and 151 (U+0097).
#   ElseIf the word matches [0-9a-fA-F]+ search for this both as a word
#   and as a hexadecimal number; e.g., 'beef' → 'beef' and 48879
#   (U+BEEF).
#   Else search for the word as-is.
