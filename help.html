<!--
NOTE
The Find text consists of one or more required words, plain words,
unwanted words, and code points.
Examples:
arrow matches any character whose description includes "arrow"
arrow left matches any character whose description includes "arrow" _and_
     "left"
arrow left? right? matches any character whose description includes
     "arrow" _and_ _either_ "left" _or_ "right"
2026 matches any character whose codepoint is 2026 decimal or 0x07EA
     hexadecimal (since 07EA base 16 = 2026 base 10).
In general it should work as expected: use word for required, 
word? for optional (but at least one of these must match), -word for
unwanted. And to look up by codepoint just enter the decimal or
hexadecimal value.

<font color=blue size=5>The purpose of the game is to remove all the
tiles.</font>

<font color=#008000 size=4>
Click a tile that has at least one vertically or horizontally adjoining tile
of the same color to remove it and any vertically or horizontally adjoining
tiles of the same color, and <i>their</i> vertically or horizontally
adjoining tiles, and so on. <i>(So clicking a tile with no adjoining tiles
of the same color does nothing.)</i> The more tiles that are removed in one
go, the higher the score.
